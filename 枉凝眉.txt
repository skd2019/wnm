*	一个是阆苑仙葩
	One was a flower from paradise
	
*	一个是美玉无瑕
	One a pure jade without spot or stain
	
*	若说没奇缘 今生偏又遇着他
	if each for other one was not intended，then why in this life did they meet again?
	
*	若说有奇缘 如何心事终虚化？
	And yet if fate had meant them for each other,why was their earthly meeting all in vain?
	
*	一个枉自嗟呀
	In vain were all her sighs and tears
	
*	一个是空劳牵挂
	in vain were all his anxious fears
	
*	一个是水中月 一个是镜中花
	All,insubstantial,doomed to pass,as moonlight mirrored in the water or flowers reflected in a glass
	
*	想眼中能有多少泪珠儿，
	How many tears from those poor eyes could flow
	
*	怎禁得秋流到冬尽 春流到夏
	which every season rained upon her woe.
